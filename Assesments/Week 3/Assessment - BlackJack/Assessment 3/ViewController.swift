class ViewController: UIViewController {
    // BlackJack game: Create a a game of Blackjack
    // ************* Baseline requirements:
    // ** Set up Player class and CardGame class in their respective provided files. Follow the protocol rules for the CardGame class.
    // When card game first starts, a new player is generated and handed out 2 cards (between 1 and 11). Hint: generate 2 random numbers and add them together
    // A value for the CPU is also generated between 12 and 21 (random Int)
    // When the green view is double tapped (tap gesture recognizer), generate a new card (between 1 and 11) for the player, and add it to their score
    // If the total adds up to over 21, change the label text to "Game over, you lose!" and remove the ability for the player to keep tapping for cards
    // If the player wishes to not get dealt any more cards, the player can swipe right to end game (swipe gesture recognizer)
    // When the player ends the game, present the CPU score and present winner determined from compre comparison
    
    // Bonus: Create a button to play a new game.
    // Bonus 2: Player can start with a pool of money (selected through a text field) and make bets for each game (through a text field again). If player reaches <= 0, don't allow them to play any more games.
    // Bonus 3: When handing out cards, display the actual value to the user. If the card is an Ace, let the user select either 1 or 11.
